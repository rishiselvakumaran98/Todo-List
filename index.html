<a id="todo-list" class="anchor" href="#todo-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Todo-List</h1>
<p>This is a very simple ToDo list created by me using HTML, CSS Styling, Vanilla JS and Basic Jquery DOM Manipulation.</p>
<h1>
<a id="features-of-list" class="anchor" href="#features-of-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features of list:</h1>
<ul>
<li>To Add items to the list just type in the top input box of the list and hit enter to place item onto list</li>
<li>To mark item/task as completed click on the item and it will get marked off. Click again and the item gets displayed without the line-through.</li>
<li>To delete items hover over the items to the left and you should see an animated trash icon; Upon clicking the trash icon the item gets deleted from the list</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a id="potential-cons" class="anchor" href="#potential-cons" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Potential Cons:</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list is static as it is based on a HTML template and hence any item added will not get stored as there is no Database routed to this APP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list is singular, and while I did attempt to make multiple lists in the webpage, due to time constraint, it was not possible for me to incorporate them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a id="how-they-all-work-together" class="anchor" href="#how-they-all-work-together" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How they all work together:</h1>
<p>The Display site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The application frontend was created using a HTML file (index.html) and style links to the CSS files and JS files were given under the heading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The animation and design was implemented using a CSS file "assets/css/todos.css", where basic fading and trash icon sliding were animated under their respective tags and ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Backend works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The backend works such as clicking, adding, and deleting functions for the list items were done using Basic Jquery DOM Manipulation, where I was able to select the HTML elements using their respective IDs and then perform functions on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was very useful to refer to the JQuery documentation website for some of the Jquery functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted this project to be accomplished using simple tools such HTML, CSS Styling, Vanilla JS and Basic Jquery DOM Manipulation, it was a success that I was able to complete them using these tools and nothing more; (Well I deployed them using Heroku;) )</p>
<p>Otherwise, feel free to see my project and use them!</p>
